# Write a function to find numbers divisible by two numbers.
Define a function that takes 3 parameters(all positive integers) in this order:
num1, num2, end_num

Function should return a list of all numbers less than end_num that are divisible by both num1 and num2.

_Example:_

**Input:**


    2, 3, 13
    

**Output:**


    [6, 12]
    
    
_Challenge:_
Write the function without using for-loop.
